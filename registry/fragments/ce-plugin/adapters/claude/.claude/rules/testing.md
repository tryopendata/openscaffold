# Testing

Load the `ce:writing-tests` skill before writing or rewriting tests. When a test passes alone but fails in the suite, or fails intermittently, load `ce:fixing-flaky-tests` instead of adding retries or sleeps.

The project's test layers, runners, and harness files are in the Testing section of `AGENTS.md`; the commands are in its Commands table. Build on the existing harness rather than around it.

- Test behavior through the public surface, against real dependencies where practical. Fake only third-party network calls.
- Wait on conditions, never on fixed sleeps.
- A failing test is information. Don't weaken, skip, or delete it to get green without saying so.

| Symptom | Likely cause |
| --- | --- |
| Passes alone, fails in the suite | Shared state between tests |
| Fails at random | Timing or ordering dependence |
| Passes locally, fails in CI | Environment difference (env vars, ports, time zone, file order) |
